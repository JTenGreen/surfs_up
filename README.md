Overview of the Analysis:
The goal of the Analysis was to view the temperature statistics for June and December in Oahu, to determine whether or not a surf and ice cream shop would be a viable business year-round.
The results where obtained via a query that captured the temperatures during June and December and retrieving the minimum, maximum and average temperatures.

Results:
June Analysis:
Reviewing the data for June we can see that we have 1700 observations, from 2010 to 2017.

December Analysis:
Reviewing the data for December we can see that we have 1517 observations, from 2010 to 2017, compared to the results from June we can assume there are some missing data entries.

Summary:
Keeping in mind Decembers missing data entries (which doesn't affect the analysis too much as we have a large amount of data anyways) we can infer that Oahu's weather doesn't fluctuate too much, we would also keep in mind other weather factors such as precipitation to make a correct decision whether or not Oahu is a prime location, more queries would need to be run.
